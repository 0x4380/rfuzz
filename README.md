# rfuzz
Python script for asynchrous fuzz multiple URL and routes

Simply run:
```
pip3 install aiohttp
pip3 install asyncio
python3 rfuzz.py
```

put domains in domains.lst file
and routes in routes.lst file (By default it's fuzz.txt)

P.S. I'm glad to see better and optimized ways to send multiple asyncrhous requests! Write issues and make PRs
